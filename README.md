## Overview
This project aims to use the fundamentals of assembling complex objects from simple parts using the matrix stack. I chose to animate a 3D cat using simple geometric shapes in Processing. The cat animation includes various parts such as the body, head, legs, arms, tail, and additional features like ears, eyes, whiskers, and a collar. Additionally, fish are instantiated as part of the animation to complement the scene.

### Features
- Cat Animation: The cat consists of various geometric shapes such as cylinders, spheres, and cones. It includes animations for legs and tail, simulating natural movements.
- Fish Instancing: Multiple fish are added to the scene, moving in a synchronized manner to enhance the overall animation.
- Camera Movement: The camera smoothly transitions through different positions to provide dynamic views of the animated scene.
- Lighting: Ambient and directional lighting is used to create a visually appealing 3D environment.
  
### How to Run
1. Download and install Processing.
2. Open the provided .pde file in the Processing IDE.
3. Run the sketch to see the 3D cat animation in action.
